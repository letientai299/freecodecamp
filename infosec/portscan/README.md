# Port Scanner

## Note

I'm too lazy to render the solution in HTML like those in [pyda](../../pyda).
This is mostly about `socket` module in Python.

Time for this: **1h**

## Problem description

### Assignment

Create a port scanner using Python.

In the `port_scanner.py` file, create a function called `get_open_ports` that
takes a `target` argument and a `port_range` argument. `target` can be a URL or
IP address. `port_range` is a list of two numbers indicating the first and last
numbers of the range of ports to check.

Here are examples of how the function may be called:

```
get_open_ports("209.216.230.240", [440, 445])
get_open_ports("www.stackoverflow.com", [79, 82])
```

The function should return a list of open ports in the given range.

The `get_open_ports` function should also take an optional third argument of
`True` to indicate "Verbose" mode. If this is set to true, the function should
return a descriptive string instead of a list of ports.

Here is the format of the string that should be returned in a verbose mode (text
inside `{}` indicates the information that should appear):

```
Open ports for {URL} ({IP address})
PORT     SERVICE
{port}   {service name}
{port}   {service name}
```

You can use the dictionary in `common_ports.py` to get the correct service name
for each port.

For example, if the function is called like this:

```
port_scanner.get_open_ports("scanme.nmap.org", [20, 80], True)
```

It should return the following:

```
Open ports for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)
PORT     SERVICE
22       ssh
80       http
```

Make sure to include proper spacing and new line characters.

If the URL passed into the `get_open_ports` function is invalid, the function
should return the string: "Error: Invalid hostname".

If the IP address passed into the `get_open_ports` function is invalid, the
function should return the string: "Error: Invalid IP address".

### Development

Write your code in `port_scanner.py`. For development, you can use `main.py` to
test your code. Click the "run" button and `main.py` will run.

### Testing

The unit tests for this project are in `test_module.py`. We imported the tests
from `test_module.py` to `main.py` for your convenience. The tests will run
automatically whenever you hit the "run" button.

### Submitting

Copy your project's URL and submit it to freeCodeCamp.
